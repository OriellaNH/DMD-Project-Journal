Digital Media Pioneers

•	Name three digital media pioneers mentioned in this week’s lecture.

Charles Baggage (the Diffecernce Engine 1832), Jean Bartik (programmer on ENIAC the first large scale electronic computer 1945)
Grace Hopper (created the first programming language COBOL 1959)

•	Provide an explanation of their contribution and why it’s significant.

Baggage - designed a calculaing machine which significant due to being able to calculate numbers (calculator)

Bartik - the computer was used by the US military to calculate missile trajectory calculations, she was a programmer.

Hopper - allowed operater to give the computer commands in English.

•	Name two practitioners mentioned in this week’s lecture whose work clearly straddles traditional art and science divides. 

Daphne Oram created the Optical Synthesizer Oramics machine electronic music pioneer 1960s

Ben Laposky oscilliscope (not digital or a computer) his use of them was significant in the way that he used technology for 
aesthetic rather that computational ends.

Explain the significance of one of the cultural theories discussed in today’s lecture.

Shifts in gendering of technology. Between 30% and 50% of computer programmers were women in the 1950s and it was seen as a natural 
career for them. Evidence of this is seen in a 1967 Cosmopolitan feature of 'Computer Girls'. This shows significance to me as 
computer programming seems a particularly 'intelligent' job to have, and as of history, women weren't seen as intelligent as 
men at this time.
