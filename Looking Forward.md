•	Which aspects of Digital Media Design have you enjoyed studying most?
I have really enjoyed the practicality of making an app and piecing together bits of knowledge that I have learnt to build one product. It was satisfying to me to process through the workshops on coding and assemble all the parts to make the end piece. I specifically enjoyed learning about implanting a map onto an app and how to move it around.

•	Which aspects of Digital Media Design have you found most challenging?
In all, I have found coding the most challenging also as it is like learning a different language. I am a very visual learner and I enjoy shapes rather than words. Fixing problems and errors on Xcode has been particularly tough but they are useful in that they tell you what to fix.

•	What one piece of advice would you like to be able to give to yourself as someone beginning this unit?
Always make notes on every workshop! I did this after a few weeks and would definitely recommend starting at the beginning.

•	What will you do to ensure that you continue building-on what you’ve learnt studying Digital Media Design?
I will continue to experiment with the things I have learnt and play around with digital media design aspects. This will ensure I can build on what I’ve learnt and discover new elements of the subject.
