Digital Product Design

•	Name two concepts, which are key to both digital product design and physical product design.
Simplistic design (‘form follows function’ for user friendliness) and Formalism (aesthetic qualities in composition etc.).

•	What do you understand by the concept of ‘affordances’?
A way of recognising the way that things simultaneously enable and disable type of interaction and use. The way that things are used for a purpose.

•	What do you understand by the practice of Universal Design (and why it’s 
important)?
It is an aspiration to consider and make provision for users who may have complex and diverse abilities in design for new products. This is important to exist as it enables a safe living environment for everyone and makes things around us safe and simple to use even though we are all different.

•	Name two people whose contributions have been significant for understanding digital product design.
Jonathan Ive (Apple)
James Gibson (Affordances)

A UX designer would use a more user-focused method. As well as emotional design, creating thinking and prototyping tools.

•	How will you incorporate this knowledge into your own app design?
This week I will incorporate this knowledge into my app designing by ensuring that my app is suitable for everyone’s use. I twill need to be user-friendly and easy to follow as well as appealing in aesthetic and practicality.
