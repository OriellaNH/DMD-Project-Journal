Data Collection and Ethics

•	Why is ‘data persistence’ so important?
The process of storing data and not a file-system – this is important because it develops material for studying the processes of creativity when information is given and put into a system.

•	Name two situations where data persistence is key.
The general election, recommender systems (recommending things to people online).

•	What is meant by ‘big data’?
The process in which large datasets of information are amassed.

•	What is one of the key ethical issues surrounding big data?
Although it has many benefits, privacy (data protection) is a key concern and issue within ‘big data’.

•	Name one recent high-profile example where there has been seen to be an unethical use of data.
The Vietnam/American War’s ‘birthday list’ saw a list of men who were conscripted to fight in the war and another list of boys who were able to receive a gift on their birthday. In combining these lists, the US government had a correlation of data to discover names of boys who should be conscripted to fight the war.
